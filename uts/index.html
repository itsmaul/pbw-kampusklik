                <h3>My Profile</h3>
                <p>
                    Let me introduce myself first. My name is Risma Auliya Salsabilla.
                    However, most people call me Maul. I was born in Karawang on February 21, 2004.
                    I am currently 20 years old, already in my twenties more precisely.
                    At the moment, I am in the fourth semester of college.
                    My major at the university is informatics.

                <h3>My Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    I am known as quite extroverted by people around me. My MBTI sometimes fluctuates,
                    but it consistently returns to being an ENFJ. I have a pleasant personality and
                    am perceived as quite friendly to others. Often, even people who don't know me well
                    can feel comfortable around me, even if only briefly. 
                    My love language is quality time; I simply enjoy spending time with those I care about.
